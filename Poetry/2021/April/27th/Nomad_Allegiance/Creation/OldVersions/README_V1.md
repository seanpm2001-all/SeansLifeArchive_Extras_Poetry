# Creation of the Nomad allegiance poem

The ideas for this poem came to my head within an hour of waking up this morning. I don't know what inspired it, but a word substitution brought it the name "Nomad allegiance"

## Early draft

The early draft I had in my head had `no man` instead of `nomad` I didn't go with this, as I didn't want to extend the poem further, and I wanted to remain completely gender neutral, with no mention of gender.

## Context

Here is some important context behind this poem.

### Nomad

Description from [the English Wikipedia, as of April 27th 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad)

```plain_text:no-wrap
A nomad (Middle French: nomade "people without fixed habitation" is a member of a community without fixed habitation which regularly moves to and from the same areas. Such groups include hunter-gatherers, pastoral nomads (owning livestock), and tinkers or trader nomads In the twentieth century, population of nomadic pastoral tribes slowly decreased, reaching to an estimated 30–40 million nomads in the world as of 1995.

Nomadic hunting and gathering—following seasonally available wild plants and game—is by far the oldest human subsistence method. Pastoralists raise herds, driving or accompanying in patterns that normally avoid depleting pastures beyond their ability to recover.

Nomadism is also a lifestyle adapted to infertile regions such as steppe, tundra, or ice and sand, where mobility is the most efficient strategy for exploiting scarce resources. For example, many groups living in the tundra are reindeer herders and are semi-extra nomadic, following forage for their animals.

Sometimes also described as "nomadic" are the various itinerant populations who move among densely populated areas to offer specialized services (crafts or trades) to their residents—external consultants, for example. These groups are known as "peripatetic nomads".

To put it simply, a nomad is a person who lives in a country without a fixed home, someone who moves around a lot. Some common historical examples include the Mongols, most hunter-gatherers from the beginning of human history to the present day, the San people in Africa, and many others, although it is a style that is declining.

### Allegiance

This poem was created, as I was undecided on my Allegiance, this is mainly what inspired this, I think (I am trying to figure out an option between the United States, Switzerland, and Sweden)
